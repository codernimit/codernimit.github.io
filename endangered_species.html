<p>Have you ever wondered what happens when one type of species is extinct?</p>
<p>I strongly believe that endangered species must be protected before it’s too late.
Humans cause species to be endangered by the loss of habitat and genetic variation.
If we don’t get out of this mess, we’ll experience new disease vectors and human-animal interaction.
So we must protect endangered species.
So what is loss of habitat and genetic variation and how are humans causing it?

<h2> <marquee>How Humans Are Causing Loss Of Habitat and genetic variation</marquee> </h2>
<p>
Human activities are causing loss of habitat and genetic variation by taking up space and reducing the population.
 One way that loss of habitat is making species endangered is by clearing the land for urban use and logging.
 One example is that the Amazon rainforest is shrinking because people are clearing the land,
 to “clear” land is to remove all its vegetation from it.
 Genetic variation means the diversity found within the species.
 One example of this is that humans are reducing the population by over hunting and fishing so there are less breeding pairs because to make
 a healthy offspring, you need 2 of the same kind but with barely any similarities in their genes(DNA).
 If we continue this, what will happen to us in the future?

<h2> <marquee>What are the effects?</marquee></h2>
<p>
The effects will not be good on us if we continue this. 
“That sounds about right: drill, mine, log and pollute today, 
stick someone with the bill later on, Unfortunately “Later on” is now,” says The Wilderness society.
As human development goes deeper into the wild, we’re experiencing new viruses because more animals are coming near our areas. 
According to The Wilderness Society, “As human development pushes deeper into formerly “wild” areas, 
people are exposed to more new disease vectors(a major share of emerging infectious diseases are the kind that jump from animals to people).”
According to The Wilderness Society, 
“Studies of the Amazon have shown that deforestation increases fire risk by removing natural vegetation cover creating drier conditions.” 
Because of the problems we’re causing, we should save these species.

<H2> <marquee>SAVE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES!!!</marquee></h2>
<p>
Endangered species need to be saved. 
We can help save the environment by switching from burning fossil fuels to solar panels. 
The panels produce electricity by soaking the sun rays and it doesn’t require any burning. 
Don’t waste paper, because more trees will be cut down, producing less oxygen in the atmosphere and there’ll be less habitat for animals. 
Concluding this in simplest terms, if we save endangered species, good things will happen and if not, the opposite will happen.

<h2> <marquee>The conclusion</marquee></h2>
<p>
I strongly believe that species which are endangered must be protected before it’s too late. 
Two main causes of species extinction and endangered species are genetic variation and loss of habitat. 
If we continue this, we’ll experience new disease vectors. So we must save endangered species! 
“The rapid loss of biodiversity that we are witnessing is about much more than nature. 
The collapse of ecosystems will threaten the wellbeing and livelihoods of everyone on the planet.”
 – Linda Krueger, Director of Biodiversity and Infrastructure Policy of Nature Conservancy.
